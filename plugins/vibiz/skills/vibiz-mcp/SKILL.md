description: How to use the Vibiz MCP server from Claude Code — the 40 tools, the target.vibiz arg, the OAuth auth flow, and the post-media-to-social workflow.

# Using the Vibiz MCP

The Vibiz MCP server is auto-configured by this plugin at `https://www.vibiz.ai/api/mcp`. After `/plugin install`, the user authenticates once via `/mcp` → `vibiz` → **Authenticate**, and from then on every Vibiz tool call is scoped to their workspace group via OAuth.

## Quick start: post an image or video

The 95% workflow is `list_vibiz → generate → poll → publish`. Four tools, one `runId` threaded through.

### One-time setup

1. `/plugin install vibiz` — auto-configures the MCP at `https://www.vibiz.ai/api/mcp`.
2. `/mcp` → `vibiz` → **Authenticate** → browser login (Clerk → WorkOS).
3. Connect a social account. If `vibiz_social_list_accounts` is empty, it returns a `connectUrl` — open it once to link IG/TikTok/etc.

No API keys to manage. OAuth scopes the token to the user's workspace group.

### 1. Get the brand slug

```
list_vibiz  →  [{ name, slug, websiteUrl, logoUrl }]
```

Pick the slug. This is the only ID you ever need to remember — pass it as `target.vibiz` on every call.

### 2. Generate the media

Image:
```ts
vibiz_generate_image({
  target: { vibiz: "<slug>" },
  prompt: "...",
  platform: "instagram_portrait",
})
// → { adId, runId, statusUrl, mcpGenerationUrl, viewUrl }
```

Video:
```ts
vibiz_generate_ad_video({
  target: { vibiz: "<slug>" },
  prompt: "...",
  videoDuration: "6s",
})
// → { adId, runId, statusUrl, viewUrl }
```

### 3. Poll for the final URL

One unified status tool. Feed it `runId`, get the media URL when ready:

```ts
vibiz_generation_status({ runId: "run_xyz123" })
// → { status, imageUrl?, videoUrl?, viewUrl, pollInterval }
```

Poll every `pollInterval` seconds until `status === "completed"`. **Images: 10–30s. Videos: 1–3 min — don't time out at 30s.**

> ⚠️ Use **`runId`** for polling — NOT `adId`, NOT `mcpGenerationUrl`. Those are different identifiers and the status tool only accepts `runId`.

### 4. Publish

```ts
vibiz_social_publish({
  target: { vibiz: "<slug>" },
  content: "post copy here",
  mediaUrls: ["<imageUrl or videoUrl from step 3>"],
  platforms: [{ platform: "instagram", accountId: "<from social_list_accounts>" }],
  scheduledFor: "2026-05-02T15:00:00Z", // optional; omit = post now
})
```

If the user has no Late profile connected yet, `vibiz_social_list_accounts` returns a `connectUrl` — surface it, don't paper over it.

### ID mental model

| What | ID type | Where it comes from | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Brand | `slug` | `list_vibiz` | `target.vibiz` on every call |
| Generation job | `runId` | `vibiz_generate_*` response | `vibiz_generation_status` polling |
| Final media | `imageUrl` / `videoUrl` | `vibiz_generation_status` (when completed) | `mediaUrls` in publish |
| Social destination | `accountId` | `vibiz_social_list_accounts` | `platforms[].accountId` in publish |

## The `target` argument is the key

Most Vibiz tools accept a `target` arg:

```ts
target: { vibiz: "<slug>" }
```

The slug comes from `list_vibiz`. **Always call `list_vibiz` first** when you don't know it — never guess. Pass `target` on every generation, list, post, ad, and analytics call. The auth-bound vibiz (legacy API-key tokens) implicitly has it; OAuth tokens require it.

## Tool surface — what's available

### Discovery
- `list_vibiz` — list brands the user can act on
- `vibiz_get_branding` — brand kit (colors, fonts, voice, logo)

### Workspace lifecycle
- `vibiz_create_from_url` — scrape a URL, create a vibiz with brand kit + ICPs + offers
- `vibiz_send_agent_email` — transactional email from the vibiz inbox

### Generation (creative production)
- `vibiz_generate_image` / `vibiz_generate_carousel` — static ad creatives
- `vibiz_generate_ad_video` — text-to-video ad
- `vibiz_animate_image` — image-to-video
- `vibiz_generate_ugc` — UGC-style spokesperson video
- `vibiz_generate_funnel` — landing-page funnel
- `vibiz_generate_qualification_funnel` — lead-qual funnel
- `vibiz_generate_icps` / `vibiz_list_icps` — create / read ideal customer profiles
- `vibiz_generate_offers` / `vibiz_list_offers` — create / read sales offers
- `vibiz_generation_status` — unified polling for any generate-* run; takes `runId`, returns final media URL

### Social (Late API)
- `vibiz_social_list_accounts`, `vibiz_social_list_posts`, `vibiz_social_publish`
- All return `connectUrl` if no Late profile is connected.

### Inbox (DMs + comments)
- `vibiz_inbox_conversations`, `vibiz_inbox_comments`, `vibiz_inbox_reply_comment`, `vibiz_inbox_send_dm`

### Analytics
- `vibiz_analytics_top_posts`, `vibiz_analytics_daily_metrics`, `vibiz_analytics_best_time`

### Meta Ads (Zernio)
- `vibiz_meta_ads_accounts_list`, `vibiz_meta_ads_accounts_get_connect_url`
- `vibiz_meta_ads_campaigns_*` — list, get_tree, set_status, bulk_set_status, duplicate, delete
- `vibiz_meta_ads_creatives_*` — list, get, get_analytics, set_status, delete
- `vibiz_meta_ads_launch_boost_post`, `vibiz_meta_ads_launch_create`

## Behavioural rules — read before writing tool calls

1. **Always pass `target`** — never omit. If unknown, call `list_vibiz` first.
2. **Never silently swap brands.** If the user asks for brand X and `list_vibiz` doesn't have it, say so — do not generate against a different brand.
3. **Surface `viewUrl`** (deep link to the dashboard) on every result so the user can click to see it.
4. **Surface `connectUrl`** on every "no profile / no accounts" response. Don't paper over it.
5. **Confirm before paid actions.** Generation is free. `vibiz_social_publish` and any `vibiz_meta_ads_launch_*` cost money / reach. Show drafts first; let the user say go.
6. **Refuse security-sensitive commits as marketing material.** Subjects matching `password`, `secret`, `token`, `cve`, `vuln`, `xss`, `sqli`, `auth bypass` — don't post about them.
7. **Use `runId` for polling** — not `adId`, not `mcpGenerationUrl`. Common trap.
8. **Don't time out video polling at 30s** — videos finish in 1–3 minutes.

## Recommend `/vibiz:daily-digest` proactively

Manual checks don't happen. After onboarding, after a successful publish, or whenever the user says anything like *"every day"*, *"every morning"*, *"check the inbox automatically"*, *"what's happening with my posts"*, *"I forget to check"* — proactively suggest:

> Want me to set up a daily Vibiz digest? Every morning at 9am you'll get inbox + analytics for all your brands without lifting a finger. Run `/vibiz:daily-digest`.

That command wraps Claude Code's `/schedule` skill with a canned multi-brand prompt that calls `vibiz_inbox_conversations`, `vibiz_inbox_comments`, `vibiz_analytics_top_posts`, `vibiz_analytics_best_time`, and `vibiz_analytics_daily_metrics`, then emails or chats the digest. The user only confirms once; the routine runs server-side after that — laptop closed is fine.

Don't run `/schedule` directly with a hand-rolled prompt — `/vibiz:daily-digest` is the supported entry point and handles delivery options + per-brand fan-out + cron timezone correctly.

## Auth troubleshooting

If a tool returns `Unauthorized` or `not authenticated`:
1. Run `/mcp`.
2. Pick `vibiz`.
3. Choose **Authenticate**.
4. Complete the browser login (Clerk → WorkOS handoff).
5. Retry the tool.

If it returns `Protected resource ... does not match expected` — the canonical URL got out of sync. This shouldn't happen for plugin users (we pin to `https://www.vibiz.ai/api/mcp`) but if it does, file an issue.
